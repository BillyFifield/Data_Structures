# Data_Structures

In this Data Structures repository, there are many different examples of different data structures using Python. Some data structures are used to build
other data structures, so things like static arrays and dynamic arrays will be used to assist in building the other structures.

What is not allowed in these data structures are the built-in pythonic data types (tuples are allowed). So the pythonic list and dictionaries are not used.
